# Refactoring JavaScript:-
----------------------------------
 * **There's a middle ground between speed and comprehension and that's where good code lives**.
 * Be explicit and throw an error so that problems can be spotted during development.
 * A hash function is used to map a given key to a location in the hash table. 
 * We can't go around writing functions for every option. Let's write one function that accepts a list of friendly things.
 
 ### Here are some straightforward to implement methods that can lead to easier to read code:-
 ----------------------------------
 > Return early from functions.
 > Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences.
 > Check for Web APIs before implementing your own functionality:

----------------------------------
# Functional programming:-
----------------------------------
* Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
*  Here is a very strict definition of purity:
> It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).
> It does not cause any observable side effects.
