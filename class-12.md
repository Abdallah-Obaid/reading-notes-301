# EJS partial:-
----------------------------------
 * **Partials** come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.
 * We use <%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %> where the partial file is relative to the template you use it in.
 * Creating and including partials is very straightforward with EJS..
 
 # EJS Options:-
----------------------------------
* cache Compiled functions are cached, requires filename
* filename Used by cache to key caches, and for includes
* context Function execution context
* compileDebug When false no debug instrumentation is compiled
* client Returns standalone compiled function
* delimiter Character to use with angle brackets for open/close
* debug Output generated function body
* _with Whether or not to use with() {} constructs. If false then the locals will be stored in the locals object.
* localsName Name to use for the object storing local variables when not using with Defaults to locals
* rmWhitespace Remove all safe-to-remove whitespace, including leading and trailing whitespace. It also enables a safer version of -%> line slurping for all scriptlet tags (it does not strip new lines of tags in the middle of a line).
* escape The escaping function used with <%= construct. It is used in rendering and is .toString()ed in the generation of client functions. (By default escapes XML).
* outputFunctionName Set to a string (e.g., 'echo' or 'print') for a function to print output inside scriptlet tags.
* async When true, EJS will use an async function for rendering. (Depends on async/await support in the JS runtime.
