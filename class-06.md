# Node, Express, and APIs:-
----------------------------------
 * Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
 * The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi.
 * The creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.
 * Version manager instead: This is a program that allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will.
 * node -v: to check if the node is installed.
 * Node has excellent support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond.
 * Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm.
 * npm -v: to check if the npm is installed.
 * Node common uses: installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.
