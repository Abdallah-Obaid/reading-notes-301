# APIs:-
----------------------------------
 * APIs stand for:application programming interface.
 * API is a computing interface to a software component or a system, that defines how other components or systems can use it.
 * API defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc.
 * API can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.
 * The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.
 * API (application programming interface) simplifies programming by abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs.
 * **An API for file input/output might give the developer a function that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the file system operations occurring behind the scenes**
 * Dark Sky API: allows you to look up the weather anywhere on the globe.
 * Locationiq: Blazing Fast Geocoding, Maps & Routing Enterprise-grade Location APIs for everyone.
