# Diversity and Inclusion in the workspace:-
----------------------------------
* **Diversity** efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders, And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.
* Studies indicate that **diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation**.
* "Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it." by Scott E. Page.
* At Intel, CEO Brian Krzanich has said: "A fully diverse and inclusive workplace is fundamental to our ability to innovate and deliver business results."
* Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to **miss out on incredible talent**.
* **Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base**
