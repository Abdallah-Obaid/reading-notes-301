# SQL:-
----------------------------------
 * SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
 * SQL **is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database**.
 * SQL databases including SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.
 * relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables.
 * By learning SQL, the goal is to learn how to answer specific questions about this data.
 * To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements.
 * A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned.
 * we can then use the asterisk (*) shorthand in place of listing all the column names individually.
 * We use where to filter rows.
 * In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query. 
 * AND or OR logical keywords can be added whith where query.
